1) openCV images coordinates are y,x or height, width
2) OpenCV 0,0 is upper left corner
3) In Translation Negative values move left and up, positive move right, and down.

Define a translation matrix to shift an image 30 pixels up and 50 pixels to the right.
M = np.float32([[1, 0, 50], [0, 1, -30]])

Define a translation matrix to shift an image 90 pixels down and 10 pixels to to the left.
M = np.float32([[1, 0, 50], [0, 1, 90]])

4) In Rotation Negative numbers is clockwise and positive numbers are counter clockwise
5) general rule, cv2.INTER_LINEAR  interpolation method is recommended as the default for whenever you’re upsampling or downsampling

6) when using flip 1 is horizontal, 0 is vertical, and -1 is both horizontal and vertical flipping.

7) Bitwise on is greater than 0, off = 0.
    AND: A bitwise AND is true if and only if both pixels are greater than zero.
    OR: A bitwise OR is true if either of the two pixels are greater than zero.
    XOR: A bitwise XOR is true if and only if one of the two pixels is greater than zero, but not both.
    NOT: A bitwise NOT inverts the “on” and “off” pixels in an image.
8) Essentially, the bitwise NOT function flips pixel values

9) Kernels can be an arbitrary size of M \times N pixels, provided that both M and N are odd integers.

10) as the size of the kernel increases, so will the amount in which the image is blurred.
11) always consider your lighting conditions before you write a single line of code!
