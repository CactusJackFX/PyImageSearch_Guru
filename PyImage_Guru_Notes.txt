1) openCV images coordinates are y,x or height, width
2) OpenCV 0,0 is upper left corner
3) In Translation Negative values move left and up, positive move right, and down.

Define a translation matrix to shift an image 30 pixels up and 50 pixels to the right.
M = np.float32([[1, 0, 50], [0, 1, -30]])

Define a translation matrix to shift an image 90 pixels down and 10 pixels to to the left.
M = np.float32([[1, 0, 50], [0, 1, 90]])

4) In Rotation Negative numbers is clockwise and positive numbers are counter clockwise
